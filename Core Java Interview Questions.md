#### 1. What is JDK, JRE and JVM? What is the difference between them?

**What is JDK?** 
- JDK stands for Java Development Kit. JDK is a complete software development kit that provides everything needed to develop, compile, debug, and run Java applications.
- It provides all the necessary tools, libraries, and environments to compile, debug, and run Java programs.
- It includes the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and essential development tools like the Java Compiler (javac), Debugger (jdb), and various libraries.
- It provides javac (Java Compiler) to convert source code (.java) into bytecode (.class).
- It allows the packaging of Java applications using jar (Java Archive).
- Developers must install JDK to write and run Java programs.

**Components of JDK:**
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment) - To run Java applications.
- Java Compiler (javac) - Converts Java code into bytecode.
- Java Debugger (jdb) - Helps debug Java programs.
- Java Archive Tool (jar) - Used to create JAR files.
- Java Documentation Tool (javadoc) - Generates documentation.
- Additional Tools - For monitoring, security, and management.

**What is JRE?**
- JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
- JRE is a subset of JDK that provides an environment for running Java applications but does not include development tools like the compiler.
- The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) includes everything needed to run Java applications.
- JRE includes native libraries (.dll, .so, .dylib) that help JVM interact with the operating system.
- JRE is used only for running Java programs, not for development.
- It includes JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to execute Java bytecode.
- It does not include the Java Compiler (javac).
- If you only need to run Java applications, JRE is sufficient.
- JRE = JVM + Core Java Libraries + Native Libraries + Config Files

**Components of JRE**
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine) - Executes Java bytecode.
- Java Class Libraries - Collections, File handling, Networking, etc.
- Supporting Files - Configuration files for execution.

**What is JVM?** 
- JVM Stands for Java Virtual Machine?
- It is responsible for converting Java bytecode into machine-specific code and executing it.
- JVM is platform-independent, meaning the same Java bytecode can run on different operating systems.
- It performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for optimized execution.
- It manages memory allocation and garbage collection automatically.
- It provides runtime security by preventing unauthorized memory access.
- JVM follows the WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere) principle.

**Components of JVM:**
- Class Loader - Loads .class files into memory.
- Runtime Memory Areas - Stack, Heap, Method Area, etc.
- Execution Engine - Converts bytecode into native code (machine-level).
- Garbage Collector - Manages memory automatically.
- Security Manager - Ensures Java application security
- JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time Compiler) â†’ Mostly written in C++ for optimizing bytecode execution.
- JVM = Class Loader + Memory Areas + Execution Engine + Native Interface
