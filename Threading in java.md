# Threading In Java

## What is Thread?

- A thread in java is a light-weighted process, or we can say the smallest part of the process that allows a program to operate/execute more efficiently by running multiple tasks simultaneously.    
- In order to perform complicated tasks in the background, we use the thread concept in java. All the tasks are executed without affecting the main program.  
- In a program/process, all the threads have their own separate path for execution. So, each thread of a process is independent.
- Another benifit of using threads is that if a thread gets an exception or error at the time of its execution, it does not affect execution of the other threads.
- When multiple threads are executed parallel at the same time, this process is known as multi-threading.
